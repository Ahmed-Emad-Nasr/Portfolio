 *
 * The skill taxonomy from the CV. The site used to show skills only as tags
 * scattered inside individual roles and cases — there was no single place
 * saying "this is what I work with".
 *
 * The advantage of it being data rather than JSX: each group carries
 * `evidence` — the ids of the cases that demonstrate that skill. That turns
 * a skills list (a claim) into an evidence graph (a demonstration). Start by
 * linking the ones you are confident about; the rest render normally without
 * links.
 *
 * The ids must match `caseEvidenceLibrary[].id` in config/cases.ts.

   * The cases that demonstrate this group.
   *
   * The label is written out here rather than looked up from
   * caseEvidenceLibrary on purpose: the component that renders skills is a
   * client component, so importing the case library would have bundled
   * 42KB of blog data into the home page just to read 13 titles. This
   * small amount of duplication is far cheaper.
   *
   * The id must match caseEvidenceLibrary[].id — if you change an id in
   * cases.ts, change it here too, or the link becomes a 404.
