/*
 * Part of splitting up portfolio.ts (which was 70KB in a single module).
 * Everything here moved across verbatim — no change to the data itself,
 * only the split.
 *
 * Why? layout.tsx imported knowledgeEducationItems from the big file, and
 * that dragged all 38 cases, every screenshot and every YouTube video into
 * the same module graph — on every page, including the ones that need none
 * of it. Relying on tree-shaking to separate them works in theory, but with
 * one module holding everything it is a bet rather than a guarantee.
 * Separate files make the separation real.
 *
 * portfolio.ts still exists as a re-exporting barrel, so every existing
 * import keeps working and nothing broke.
