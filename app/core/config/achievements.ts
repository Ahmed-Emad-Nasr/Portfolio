 * The "Awards & Achievements" section existed in the CV and was absent from
 * the site entirely. That is the strangest gap between the two: these
 * numbers (Top 1% on TryHackMe, 44th of 450 in a CTF, first among 250
 * trainees) are the strongest thing someone early in their career has —
 * third-party competitive evidence rather than self-description.
 *
 * Stored as data rather than JSX so it can be filtered, turned into JSON-LD
 * and read by the command palette without being repeated.
