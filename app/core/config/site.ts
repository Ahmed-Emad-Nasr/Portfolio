 * One source for the absolute URLs written into the sitemap, the RSS feed,
 * the canonical tags and the OG tags.
 *
 * ⚠️ TRAILING_SLASH must match `trailingSlash` in next.config.mjs.
 * If they disagree, this happens: the sitemap tells Google /blog/case-x and
 * the site redirects to /blog/case-x/ — so Google sees two different URLs
 * for one page and splits its ranking between them.
 *
 * How to tell? Open next.config.mjs:
 *   trailingSlash: true   → leave this true (the build emits blog/case-x/index.html)
 *   absent or false       → set this false (the build emits blog/case-x.html)

/*
 * This was true, and the deployed site answers /Portfolio/blog **without**
 * a slash — and next.config.mjs has no trailingSlash. The result was that
 * the sitemap, og:url, the JSON-LD @id and the RSS links all stated URLs
 * with a trailing slash, while the canonical tag and the real in-page links
 * had none.
 *
 * So you were presenting Google with two different URLs for the same page,
 * and the one in the sitemap was not the one that opens.
 *
 * This is not a path detail — it is SEO. If you change your mind and set
 * trailingSlash: true in next.config.mjs, set this back to true so the two
 * stay in agreement.
