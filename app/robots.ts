/*
 * robots.ts
 * Author: Ahmed Emad Nasr
 *
 * ⚠️ Important: crawlers read robots.txt from the domain root only — i.e.
 * https://ahmed-emad-nasr.github.io/robots.txt, not /Portfolio/robots.txt.
 * That root is shared across all your GitHub Pages projects, so it is not
 * under this repository's control.
 *
 * This file is useful in two cases: if you put a custom domain on the root,
 * or as a reference stating your intent. The sitemap itself works fine —
 * submit it manually from Search Console.
